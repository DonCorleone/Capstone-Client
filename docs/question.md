thank you guys. i also think that we can use bootstrap in general. but bootstrap 4.x offers a lot of utility classes to set margin, padding etc. i use them extensively. eg:

```html
<div class="footer fixed-bottom bg-dark text-white pb-3">
```

i hope it is not illegal according the the specs definition

    No inline CSS permitted and no styling of HTML elements directly

What do you think? It would be nice to have a binding statement.
